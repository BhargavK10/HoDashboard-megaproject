🧠 3️⃣ What this prepares you for (important)
1️⃣ Backend-ready data shape
{
  total: 420,
  years: [
    { year: "FY", count: 150 },
    { year: "SY", count: 140 },
    { year: "TY", count: 130 }
  ]
}


Later API:

GET /api/students/summary


UI stays the same.

2️⃣ Simple, fast rendering

No heavy charts here — just numbers:

fast to load

readable at a glance

ideal for overview page

3️⃣ Consistent UX with other cards
Card	Action
Attendance	Summary → page
Notices	Latest → page
Approvals	Pending → modal/page
Students	Counts → page

This feels intentional and professional.

🔮 4️⃣ Optional future upgrades (not now)

Mini bar per year (like attendance)

Gender ratio summary

Active vs inactive students

Batch-wise drilldown

Your current design already supports all of these.
