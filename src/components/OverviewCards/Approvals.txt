🧠 3️⃣ What this card is preparing you for (important)
1️⃣ Backend-friendly data shape

Each approval item is an object, not text:

{
  id: 1,
  applicant: "Prof. A. Sharma",
  type: "Casual Leave",
  date: "12 Mar",
}


Later, backend response might be:

{
  "id": 1,
  "teacherId": 42,
  "leaveType": "Medical",
  "from": "2025-03-11",
  "to": "2025-03-13",
  "reason": "Fever",
  "status": "PENDING"
}


You’ll map it once, UI stays the same.

2️⃣ Click behavior is already correct
onClick={() => setActive("Approvals")}


Right now:

Takes user to Approvals page

Later:

You’ll replace this with:

open modal

pass req.id

fetch full leave application

Zero refactor needed.

3️⃣ Limited items (overview responsibility)
approvals.slice(0, 4)


Why?

Overview page = summary

Full list lives on Approvals page

Backend can return many entries

4️⃣ UX consistency with other cards
Card	Pattern
Attendance	summary → page
Notices	latest → page
Approvals	pending → page/modal

Your dashboard now feels cohesive, not random.

🔮 4️⃣ What we’ll do next (when you’re ready)

Next step (natural progression):

Click approval → open modal

Modal shows:

teacher name

leave dates

reason

Buttons:

✅ Approve

❌ Reject

Backend call:

POST /api/leave/{id}/approve


The card already supports this future.
