3️⃣ How this card is designed (important)
🔹 Why these metrics?

Department Average → overall performance

Pass Rate → key HOD KPI

Year-wise Avg → identifies problem batches

At-risk Count → actionable insight

This mirrors how real academic dashboards work.

🔹 Why no subject data here?

Because:

overview = summary

details belong on the Exams page

avoids clutter & performance issues

🔹 Visual logic

Same progress bar + color logic as Attendance

Same card layout pattern as other cards

Same click-to-navigate behavior

This keeps the UI consistent and professional.

4️⃣ Backend integration later (zero UI changes)

Later you’ll fetch:

GET /api/exams/overview


And pass it in:

<ExamsOverviewCard
  setActive={setActive}
  data={examData}
  loading={loading}
  error={error}
/>


That’s it. No refactor.

✅ Final result

Your overview page now has:

✔ Attendance
✔ Notices
✔ Approvals
✔ Students
✔ Exams

All:

consistent

backend-ready

scalable

easy to reorder later

This is very solid dashboard engineering, especially for a college project.
